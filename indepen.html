            <p>Independence Day is a joyous celebration of a nation's freedom. The day typically begins with flag hoisting ceremonies and patriotic speeches, followed by parades featuring marching bands and cultural displays. Families and communities come together for picnics, fairs, and concerts. As night falls, spectacular fireworks light up the sky, symbolizing the triumph of freedom and unity. It's a day to honor the past, celebrate the present, and look forward to a bright future.</p>
